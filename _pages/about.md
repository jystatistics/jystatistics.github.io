# About Me
Currently, I'm working in the Wu Lab as a graduate research assistant at Nevada Institute of Personalized Medicine, where I try to predict the disease outcome (phenotype) using the genomic data. I am interested in how the mathematics and statistics can be applied to the genomic area and particularly my research interests are Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS), Machine Learning, Genomic data analysis, and survival analysis. I began to work at Dr. Wu' lab since June 2019 and I'm looking forward to developing new software and methodology related with genomic data in the Wu Lab. 

=========
Outside of the lab work, I’m studying for a Ph.D. program in Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the School of Public Health, University of Nevada, Las Vegas. I received B.S. in Economics and Mathematics and M.S. in Mathematics and Statistics at Minnesota State University, Mankato where I completed my master thesis on "A Statistical Analysis and Machine Learning of Genomic data".

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, play sports and spend time with my family and friends.
