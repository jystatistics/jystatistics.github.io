# Research Overview

My research focuses on developing statistical, genomic, and machine learning methods to advance **precision fracture prediction** and improve health outcomes in aging populations.

## Current Research Areas

### 🔬 1. Personalized Fracture Trajectory Modeling (HyTrax)
- Transformer-based model for longitudinal health data  
- Integrates repeated BMD, muscle metrics, clinical risk factors, and genetics  
- Outperforms FRAX in calibration and discrimination

### 🧬 2. Longitudinal GWAS & Genetic Risk Prediction
- Time-varying effect modeling  
- Multi-ancestry analysis (WHI, SOF, MrOS, FHS)  
- Identified SPTBN1 as a key regulator of BMD trajectories

### 💪 3. Muscle–Bone Interactions
- Role of sarcopenia and muscle decline in fracture risk  
- Joint modeling of longitudinal bone and muscle measures

### 🧠 4. AI for Clinical Prediction
- Hybrid statistical + machine learning models  
- Sequential deep learning  
- Meta-analysis and evidence synthesis
