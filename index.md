Welcome to my academic homepage. I am a PhD Candidate in Biomedical Informatics at  
**The Ohio State University**, advised by **Dr. Qing Wu**.  
My research focuses on precision fracture risk prediction, integrating:

- Longitudinal modeling of bone & muscle trajectories  
- GWAS and genetic risk prediction  
- Machine learning & transformer-based models  
- Clinical risk factors and real-world data  

My goal is to build next-generation Personalized Fracture Trajectory Models that  
address disparities in aging, osteoporosis, and sarcopenia.
